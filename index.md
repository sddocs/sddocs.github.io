With any installation option, you will be prompted to select a tariff plan when launching an app for the first time.

Follow the instructions from Quick Start after that..

### Quick start

* Open the application.
* Create a preloader.
* Navigate to the Pages page and click Create new button. The new page will be created.

<span class="doc_image" id="createnew" onclick="showModal(this.getAttribute('id'))">![createnew](/assets/images/start/createnew.gif)</span>

* Design a new page using ready-made blocks, or go to step №5.
