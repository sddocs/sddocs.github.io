# What can you use preloader for?

A preloader is necessary to hide elements of the standard Shopify thank you page while new content is loaded. 
You can also use the preloader to show ads or draw customers' attention to other products in your store.

You can add to the preloader the following elements:
* video;
* animation;
* any HTML content. Use your imagination!
